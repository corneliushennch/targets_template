# Cohort overview

**Comment:** 
I created this document to learn how to create Rmarkdown documents. I won't continue working with the Rmarkdown notebook document, as re-runs all the code, which makes it too time consuming at some point. My main take-aways from writing this script were the following:

1. Setting the correct working directory for knitting is important and a little bit counter-intuitive (use `rmarkdown::render` rather than the Knit button). 
2. If set-up correctly, the same document can be knit both to HTML and PDF (via Latex). 
3. `{kable}` and `{kableExtra}` work for both output formats, if the stylings have been specified correctly for both outputs. It will even get more output format independent if tables are included by using `as_image()` or `save_kable()`. 
4. I still haven't fully figured out how to include graphics a bit more intuitively. The output formats differ a little bit in their way how they include the graphics and thus how the size and scale turns out. Latex seems to process PDF graphics in a bit more intelligent way. HTML seems to handle PNG graphics better than PDFs...
5. For now, I will continue by writing the analysis code in modular plain R scripts and using Rmarkdown just for compiling reports and presenations. I'll still have to figure out if I take the figures directly from the environment or print them already in the right size before including them.
